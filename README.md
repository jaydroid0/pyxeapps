# Readme
Awesome Python apps! PyInstaller lib used to convert .py to .exe! Command: pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole <appname>.py

# Releases
Each release will have a different app. 
Release 1 has an app, while Release 2 has a different app. But if I upload Release 1.1, it'll be R1's app but with updates and bug fixes and new features.

# Apps
As I mentioned above, each release will have different apps. These apps include basic text editors (first release) to others which I'll upload when I can.
These apps are not just thought by me, but also OpenAI ChatGPT, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Google Gemini and others.
